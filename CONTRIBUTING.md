# Contribution Guidelines

When you're making changes, please adhere to the following rules:
* Keep the style of the existing code
* Ensure your feature/bugfix is covered by specs
* When your changes are ready, run `crystal run --release benchmark/benchmark.cr` to make sure they do not drastically impact performance
  * Copy the output into the pull request (within a `code` block)
